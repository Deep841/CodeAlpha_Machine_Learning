# CodeAlpha_Machine_Learning.
Welcome to the repository for the machine learning internship tasks completed by Deep as part of the Code Alpha internship program.<br>
This repository contains the code and documentation for three distinct tasks:

1.Credit Score Prediction: The second task focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques.<br>
The code for this task is organized in the credit_score_prediction directory.<br>
Key files include:<br>
<pre>
  *credit_score_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.<br>
  *credit_score_prediction_test.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for testing the model prepared on a sample dataset.<br>
  *lgb_model.pkl: Trained model<br>
  *data/: Folder containing the dataset utilized for training and testing the credit score prediction model.<br>
    Note: The train dataset is to be converted from xlsx to csv before using. It was uploaded as xlsx due to large size.<br>
