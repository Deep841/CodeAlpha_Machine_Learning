# CodeAlpha_Machine_Learning

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning internship tasks completed by Deep as part of the Code Alpha internship program.<br>
This repository contains the code and documentation for three distinct tasks:

1. **Credit Score Prediction:**<br>
   The second task focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques.<br>
   The code for this task is organized in the `credit_score_prediction` directory.<br>
   Key files include:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **credit_score_prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **credit_score_prediction_test.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for testing the model prepared on a sample dataset.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **lgb_model.pkl:** Trained model.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **data/:** Folder containing the dataset utilized for training and testing the credit score prediction model.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Note:** The train dataset is to be converted from `.xlsx` to `.csv` before using. It was uploaded as `.xlsx` due to its large size.<br>
